# roblox-RPC

rich presence for roblox (finally)

this is pretty much automatic except that you need to be signed into roblox in firefox (cause im too lazy to impl in anything else)

## project structure 
- /src/ : Code base for the rpc part
- /roblox-offset/ : get's the offset for current place
- /roblox-starter/ : puppeteer to start roblox
- /roblox-updater/ : automates starting and getting the offset and then writing into a file
